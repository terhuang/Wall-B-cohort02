# Here we're telling DataMapper to connect to the database specified by our
# environment configuration.
#
# Heroku creates a postgres database and prepopulates our environment
# configuration in production us just because we included the `pg` gem in our
# Gemfile. HOORAY!


# Below, we're defining a custom `datatype` to represent a `Wall`. Custom data
# types that represent the problem domain you're working in are called `models`.

class Wall
  # `class` is a keyword for defining custom `datatypes`. These data types can
  # include data and methods.
  #
  # Custom data types are often built on top of and/or compose existing data
  # types.
  #
  # Remember! `String`, `Array`, `Fixnum` (i.e. whole numbers), `Float`, (i.e.
  # decimal numbers), `Hash`, etc. are datatypes you've been using all along.
  # These common data types are used across many langauges; though they may have
  # slightly different names and methods.

  include DataMapper::Resource
  # `include` is a way to say that your `Wall` is a "kind of"
  # `DataMapper::Resource`. In other words, we're building our `Wall` "on top
  # of" the `DataMapper::Resource`.
  #
  # This is an example of building "on top of" another data type. Every data
  # type built on top of `DataMapper::Resource` comes with a bunch of additional
  # methods for storing and retrievig data with a database.


  # We're going to declare what *additional* data a `Wall` is composed of, and
  # what those `data types` are. We do this with the `property` method, kindly
  # provided to us when we `include DataMapper::Resource`.
  #
  # See:
  #  * Properties user documentation: http://datamapper.org/docs/properties.html
  #  * Method documentation: http://rdoc.info/github/datamapper/dm-core/DataMapper/Model/Property:property

  property :id,          Serial
  # The `id` is a unique identifier for the wall. Think of it as a "Social
  # Security Number" for our walls. By using the `Serial` datatype we ensure
  # this property is unique for every single wall we insert into our database.

  property :created_by, String
  # Here we can store the name of the person who created the wall. `String`
  # properties can only be 255 characters long; so only use them when you don't
  # need to store a lot of words.


  property :title, String
  # This is a human-friendly name for the wall. We'll use it on the index page;
  # as well as the header of the wall page.

  property :description, Text
  # A bit more detail about a wall. `Text` properties can be several sentences
  # (or pages!) long; giving users the freedom to describe what the wall is for
  # to their hearts content.

  property :likes, Integer
  # Let's keep track of how many people click a "Like" button for a wall. To do
  # that, we want to use the `Integer` datatype.

  property :created_at, DateTime
  # This will let us record exacty when a wall is created.
end


# PHEW! That's a lot of new ideas! But don't worry; you'll get it! Understanding
# programming takes practice!
